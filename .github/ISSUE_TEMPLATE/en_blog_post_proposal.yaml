        Thank you for being part of the community. Let's write some stuff, shall we?

        ## Note

        This is a **no-code** proposal for blog post. If approved your blog post will be implemented by maintainers.

        If you want granular control or prefer to code yourself, refer to [Blog Post Implementation Guidelines](https://github.com/sveltevietnam/sveltevietnam.dev/blob/main/docs/DEV_BLOG_POST.md) and open a PR that directly implements your post.
