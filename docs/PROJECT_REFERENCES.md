# Svelte Vietnam - Project References

## Context

[Svelte][svelte] is a web framework. One of its defining difference vs other frameworks is the focus from the beginning on building an inclusive and well-supported community.

[Svelte Society][svelte.society] has been accepted as the official central hub that branches out to a network of international communities with an official [Code of Conduct](https://www.figma.com/exit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsveltejs%2Fcommunity%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FCODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). They have been organizing [Svelte Summits][svelte.summit] and host a regular [Svelte Radio][svelte.radio]. Community chat and forum discussion are made possible with the [Svelte Discord][svelte.discord] server.

With the recent release of [Svelte-kit][svelte.kit] 1.0 - a meta framework for Svelte, interest has been growing; companies and professionals now have solid confidence to invest in this ecosystem and its communities.

Svelte global expansion will no doubt reach Vietnam, if not already so. As of early 2023, we don’t have any official ‘Svelte Vietnam’ network; the Svelte Society site and Discord do not lead to any Vietnam sources as they do for some other communities in various countries.

It is now an unprecedented opportunity to lead this initiative in Vietnam.

## Objective

In the context we have established, this project creates an entry point for said ‘Svelte Vietnam’ community. Specifically, we will build the website **sveltevietnam.dev** with the following objective:

> **To become the inclusive and centralized information hub for the Svelte community in Vietnam.**

"Inclusive" means we should try to not be biased towards any specific ethnicity or genders and to welcome people with all background and skill levels.

## Target Audience

The target audience for **sveltevietnam.dev** includes:

1. (majority) developers who already know what Svelte is and
   - are curious about the scene / community of Svelte in Vietnam in general,
   - seek help in their work with Svelte and related technologies,
   - want to know how they can contribute,
2. job seekers & job posters,
3. sponsors who want to know how they can donate & what benefits they receive.
