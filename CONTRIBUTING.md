# Contributing to [Svelte Vietnam][github]

Thank you for stopping by. [Svelte Vietnam][github] welcomes and appreciates your contribution.

There are a couple of ways that you can start contributing to the Svelte Vietnam project today.

## [Svelte Vietnam Discord][sveltevietnam.discord]

[Discord][sveltevietnam.discord] is our primary communication channel. Say hello, participate in conversations, get help, help others, and give feedbacks to administrators.

## Translations

There is an ongoing effort to translate Svelte sites ([svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev), [kit.svelte.dev](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [learn.svelte.dev]) to Vietnamese. You can:

- contribute translation to [learn.sveltevietnam.dev](https://github.com/sveltevietnam/learn.svelte.dev/issues/1), our forked version of [learn.svelte.dev],
- join the [Svelte Vietnam Discord][sveltevietnam.discord] and participate in the `#translation` channel,
- provide your feedback and ideas in the original issue [#149](https://github.com/sveltevietnam/sveltevietnam.dev/issues/149).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently we are only focusing on translating [learn.svelte.dev] first because its repo is isolated from the others, making it easy to manage, sync, and deploy.

## The [Svelte Vietnam Blog][sveltevietnam.blog]

Submit your blog post or link a post you already published somewhere. This is a great way to contribute and at, the same time, express yourself and share your ideas and experience with the community.

- Learn more by visiting the [Svelte Vietnam Blog][sveltevietnam.blog].
- Join the `#blog` channel in [Discord][sveltevietnam.discord] for further discussion.
