      'Svelte Vietnam is not a business, nor does it intend to commercialize any project or product.
      However, money is needed if we want to build a healthy community at scale, one that can
      encourage members to connect, share, and grow via forums and events. To better understand what
      Svelte Vietnam is and trying to be, read the blog post <a class="c-link"
      href="/en/blog/20231012-svelte-vietnam-from-local-to-global">“Svelte Vietnam: from Local to
      Global”</a>.'
    reasons:
      opening: 'Specifically, Svelte Vietnam will use its fund for:'
      one:
        <strong>Maintain</strong> a stable and secure infrastructure (Cloudflare). Currently Svelte
        Vietnam is built and paid for by individual and voluntary effort. Having dedicated funding
        means these members will not have to paid for infrastructure cost out of their own pockets.
      two:
        <strong>Create</strong> high-quality content, events, and activities to promote community
        growth and open source initiatives.
      closing:
        As discussed in the <a class="c-link" href="#how">previous section</a>, the list of
        sponsors, donations, and expenses are recorded publicly by <a class="c-link"
        href="https://opencollective.com/sveltevietnam">the Svelte Vietnam Open Collective</a>.
