My first impression about Quang was someone who's calm and composed - the kind of person who doesn't rush to speak - but when he does, it's thoughtful.
He's a design director skilled at crafting impactful brand identities, where his work goes beyond aesthetics.

In this era, where AI increasingly blurs the line between traditional job titles, it's increasingly common to see people like Quang whose goal is to build things that are both aesthetic and efficient, bridging the gap between design and functionality. He's not just a designer who codes or a developer who designs.

<div class="c-callout c-callout--success c-callout--icon-confetti">
We've learned that beneath that quiet exterior is a deeply curious mind, always eager to experiment, learn, and build.
