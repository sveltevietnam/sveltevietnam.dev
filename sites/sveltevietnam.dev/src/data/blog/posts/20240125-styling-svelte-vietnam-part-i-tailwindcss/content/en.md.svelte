Buckle up as this will be a lengthy one. There will be design decisions that you might not agree with and that is okay. It was not my intention initially to write such a long post but who would have thought talking about controversial topics might take a few extra words ðŸ˜‚. You can use the table of content to help navigating quickly betweens sections. There are three parts to the "Styling Svelte Vietnam" blog series, listed below. You are reading the first one.

Let us begin.

## The TailwindCSS Debate

Tailwind has become a trending keyword and hot topic that can easily spark disagreement from different points of view. Some love it and will spend significant effort making sure you hear what they have to say. Others hate it and will affirm that Tailwind is bad and needs to be shooed away at all costs. Try searching for "Tailwind love and hate" on Google or Twitter and you will be greeted with such heated conversations. In a few words, people love Tailwind for its flexibility, development speed, and integration with existing ecosystem; people hate Tailwind for its arguably bloated CSS output and degraded readability due to the heavy use of utility classes in markup.

  <figcaption>Illustration 1: summary of the online TailwindCSS debate</figcaption>
</figure>

Here is my argument when asked about this: the "Tailwind idea" is **not** new! Using `.mx-4` instead of the otherwise explicit `margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px` has been a common practice for more than a decade in CSS libraries, namely [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). If you have worked in a project with relatively complex design system, chances are you have already encountered or even set up yourself similar abstractions.

  <figcaption>Video 1: ThePrimeagen talks about a styling system he has set up more than a decade ago</figcaption>
</figure>

The most distinguishable differences between Tailwind and previous solutions are:

1. a focus on utility classes - providing minimal abstractions that map intuitively to corresponding CSS - instead of UI components. For example, Tailwind will stop at `.ml-4` instead of `.accordion` or `.btn-primary`.
2. building upon [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), providing a powerful API for customization, and rich editor support via its [language server](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/tree/3a465543cb7aa36c258dbe094a5a2927877229b1/packages/tailwindcss-language-server).

For me, Tailwind is a great tool, and when used correctly can help boost productivity without trading off code quality and maintainability.

**Update - January 2025**

In [version 4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-beta) (in beta as of this writing),
Tailwind has introduced some significant changes to its architecture and started to push for better
  integration with the Vite ecosystem via its official Vite plugin. A lot of its API, however,
stays the same, and arguments introduced in this post are still completely valid.

</div>

## Tailwind for Quick Prototyping

When building an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) or testing ideas, a key priority is speed. Tailwind is a fitting solution for this phase as it effectively allows co-locating styles right next to markup, making it easy to set up, search, and change. Instead of spending time designing a complex project structure or coming up with a convoluted naming convention like [BEM](https://getbem.com/)...

```svelte title="BEM markup & styling"
<prototype>
  <block class="block">
    <element class="block__element block__element--modifer">
      this will definitely be refactored later
    </element>
  </block>
</prototype>

<style lang="postcss">
.block {
  & .block__element {
    &.block__element--modifier {
      /* prototype styling */
    }
  }
}
</style>
```

...why not use Tailwind's built-in classes that most developers are already familiar or can easily get up to speed with:

```svelte title="Tailwind"
<prototype>
  <block class="flex items-center mx-auto">
    <element class="py-4">
      this will definitely be refactored later
    </element>
  </block>
</prototype>
```

A project with beautiful code, fancy structure, and strict conventions but no users is not that useful, is it? Instead of debating how to name blocks and elements, or where to find the corresponding CSS for certain markup, we can save time and focus on making the actual product. This does not mean, however, that we write code recklessly: Tailwind is such a simple abstraction layer that we can easily refactor or scale up, especially when design patterns and UI requirements has come to light as the project grows.

## Tailwind for Creating Design System

As the project matures, there comes a time when we need to think/rethink about a design system (color palette, typography, spacing, ...). This is where Tailwind really shines: it allows [customizable configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for almost every aspect of the library. In the following example, we define the "Inter" font and a primary color:


<enhanced-code-block group display="tabs">

```javascript title="V3"
/// @file: tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts,md}', 'svelte.config.js'],
  theme: {
    // :::highlight
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        inter: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
      },
      colors: {
        primary: 'hsl(10 100% 54%)',
      },
    },
    // :::
  },
};
```

```css title="V4"
/* @file: app.css */
@import 'tailwindcss';

@theme {
  --font-inter: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  --color-primary: hsl(10 100% 54%);
}

```

</enhanced-code-block>


These "design tokens" may be define via CSS (Tailwind V4 only), or in Javascript, giving us the liberty of doing anything we wish as long as Javascript allows it: map, filter, transform colors, utilize API from Tailwind or other libraries, ... By specifying the above configuration, we are already granted two access points:

1. using the generated classes directly in the markup, for example:

    ```svelte
    <element class="font-inter text-primary"></element>
    ```

2. accessing design tokens in CSS via the theme variable, for example:

    <enhanced-code-block group display="tabs">

    ```css title="V3"
    .element {
      font-family: theme('fontFamily.inter');
      color: theme('colors.primary');
    }
    ```

    ```css title="V4"
    .element {
      font-family: var(--font-inter);
      color: var(--color-primary);
    }
    ```

    </enhanced-code-block>

Projects using Tailwind that I have been a part of all needed custom configuration to some extent, similar to the above example, to satisfy design requirements and coding convention. If you have worked in systems at scale using other CSS management and packaging solutions, namely [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), I assume you would agree that building a design system is a huge time-consuming undertaking. To achieve comparable complexity and flexibility to those of Tailwind, you must have had many years of experience or perhaps even built your own tooling or framework! Lately, there have been many UI solutions that either integrate with or recommend Tailwind: [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/), [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/), [shadcn/ui](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/) to name a few.

## Don't serve Tailwind. Let Tailwind serve you

Let's talk a bit about the argument that Tailwind "forces" us to add too many classes to markup, causing poor readability or maintainability; or that Tailwind makes people no longer able to write CSS. I personally think in these scenarios, we are unknowingly serving Tailwind: we think of it as a framework and its approach is sole. We should, on the contrary, view Tailwind just as a tool in a rich CSS ecosystem. Instead of only using Tailwind all the time, just do when necessary; write CSS as needed, use PostCSS on demand!

<div class="c-callout c-callout--warning">

Don't teach or learn CSS via Tailwind: that is a risky path. If you are getting started with CSS, learn the traditional, vanilla CSS. When finding solution for a practical problem, we should not start with "how do I do this in Tailwind?" but rather "what can I do in CSS?", only after which should we look into whether Tailwind provides the right abstraction for the job.

</div>

For example, instead of putting everything in the markup...

```svelte title="Markup with Tailwind"
<form class="py-4">
  <p>...</p>
  :::highlight
  <button class="mt-4 px-4 py-2 text-center font-semibold rounded-md bg-white hover:bg-black hover:text-white">
  :::
    Button
  </button>
</form>
```

...we can use Tailwind to access design tokens within CSS and extract complex patterns...

<enhanced-code-block group display="tabs">

```css title="V3"
@layer components {
  .c-btn {
    padding: theme('spacing.2') theme('spacing.4');
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: theme('fontWeight.semibold');
    border-radius: theme('borderRadius.md');
    background-color: theme('colors.white');

    &:hover {
      background-color: theme('colors.black');
      color: theme('colors.white');
    }
  }
}
```

```css title="V4"
@layer components {
  .c-btn {
    padding: calc(var(--spacing) * 2) calc(var(--spacing) * 4);
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold);
    border-radius: var(--radius-md);
    background-color: var(--color-white);

    &:hover {
      background-color: var(--color-black);
      color: var(--color-white);
    }
  }
}
```

</enhanced-code-block>

...and only use Tailwind classes for inter-relational spacing and alignment between elements:

```svelte title="Markup with Minimal Tailwind"
:::diff -
<button class="mt-4 px-4 py-2 text-center font-semibold rounded-md bg-white hover:bg-black hover:text-white">
:::
:::diff +
<button class="mt-4 c-btn">
:::
  Button
</button>
```

## Tailwind with PostCSS

To a certain extent, we can view Tailwind simply as a [PostCSS plugin](https://postcss.org/docs/postcss-plugins). This means we can use Tailwind in conjunction with other PostCSS plugins, and, vice versa, use PostCSS API to extend Tailwind configuration.

<figure>
  <img src={tailwindInPostCSSImage} class="mx-auto max-w-full rounded" width="800" height="385" alt="enhanced CSS goes through the PostCSS process including Tailwind as its plugin and come outs as vanilla CSS" />
  <figcaption>Illustration 2: Tailwind fits into the PostCSS ecosystem for enhacing CSS</figcaption>
</figure>

In the post "[Productive Dark Mode with SvelteKit, PostCSS, and TailwindCSS](http://localhost:5005/en/blog/20231110-behind-the-screen-dark-mode-with-sveltekit-tailwindcss-and-postcss)", I have introduced two special syntaxes in support for implementing dark mode. The first extends CSS:

```css title="Custom At-rule"
p {
  @dark {
    color: white;
  }
}
```

The second extends Tailwind and is used in markup:

```svelte
<p class="dark:text-white">...</p>
```

The two syntax above are equivalent in output. Both come from the same PostCSS plugin [postcss-color-scheme](https://github.com/vnphanquang/postcss-color-scheme), which I wrote. Thanks to the compatibility of Tailwind with PostCSS, we can provide two solutions for developers to utilize depending on specific each use case. And if I could write such plugin, I can assure that you can do similar, even greater things!

<div class="c-callout c-callout--info">

**Update - January 2025**

In [version 4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-beta), Tailwind is no longer strictly a
PostCSS plugin but now does it own processing. The [postcss-color-scheme](https://github.com/vnphanquang/postcss-color-scheme) package has updated its strategy to stay compatible with Tailwind V4 and provides the same API experience.

## Tailwind in Svelte

The Tailwind documentation site provides [instruction for setup and usage in SvelteKit](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit). Using Tailwind in Svelte is not that different from using it in other frameworks; techniques introduced in this series are all applicable. However, you should be cautious when using [@apply](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply). This syntax inlines actual CSS in place of specified utility classes. Let's look at the following, for example:

```css title="input.css"
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 rounded;
  padding-inline: 16px;
}
```

The output will be:

```css title="output.css"
.btn {
  font-weight: 800;
  padding-top: 8px;
  padding-bottom: 8px;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  padding-inline: 16px;
}
```

<div class="c-callout c-callout--warning">

In general, I do not recommend using `@apply`. As you can see from the example above, this feature is quite convenient. However, it mixes two different syntaxes, bringing HTML classes into CSS. If abused, this approach will create technical debt that hinders maintenance and optimization. We often use `@apply` to extract reusable CSS, but this can also be done by extending Tailwind configuration, which we will discuss deeper in the later parts of this series.

</div>

Besides, using `@apply` in `*.svelte` files should be avoided for two reasons. One is the fact that it may not work as one might expect, as [discussed here in the Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#using-apply-with-per-component-css). Secondly, the build output might be polluted with unused classes. To understand this, let's have an overview of how Tailwind works.

```javascript title=tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}'],
};
```

Tailwind's configuration contains a mandatory `content` field, which instructs the Tailwind [just-in-time compiler](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css) where in source code to read and search for applicable class names (`mx-auto`, `pl-2`, `rounded`, ...) and output corresponding CSS. Say we have the following Svelte file:

```svelte title=example.svelte
<article>...</article>

<style lang="postcss">
  article {
    /* :::highlight */
    @apply rounded;
    /* ::: */
  }
</style>
```

The output of the whole process (SvelteKit + Tailwind) looks something like this:

```css title="example.css"
article.svelte-hash {
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
:::highlight warning
.rounded {
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
:::
```

Notice the highlighted lines in yellow: they are not needed. We do not use the `rounded` class anywhere in the markup, but since "rounded" is a matching keyword in *example.svelte*, which is included in the `content` configuration`, Tailwind thinks it is necessary in the output.

<figure>
  <img src={tailwindContentImage} class="mx-auto max-w-full rounded" width="800" height="316" alt="Tailwind searches for keywords in files specified in the content configuration" />
  <figcaption>Illustration: Tailwind searches for keywords in files specified in the `content` configuration</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="c-callout c-callout--success">

In situations where output size optimization is required, understanding this will be greatly beneficial. When using [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com), for example, its class names use common keywords such as `card`, `dropdown`, `table`. As long as your source code contains these keywords, the corresponding CSS will be included in the output, whether you actually use it or not. That is why Tailwind and daisyUI provide [prefix configuration](https://daisyui.com/docs/config/#prefix), which helps transform keywords to less ambiguous ones, for example `daisy-card`, `daisy-dropdown`, `daisy-table`, ...

</div>

In short, avoid using `@apply`, and if necessary, only do so in `*.css` files to avoid complex setup or pollution in build output.

## Closing

In conclusion, I have no reason to hate Tailwind as a tool with such flexibility and productivity boost. The reasoning in this post is the foundation upon which *sveltevietnam.dev* builds its design system and structure CSS. We will discuss this in more detail in the next two parts of the "Styling Svelte Vietnam" series.
