          'Svelte Vietnam is not a business, nor does it intend to commercialize any project or
          product. However, money is needed if we want to build a healthy community at scale, one
          that can encourage members to connect, share, and grow via forums and events. To better
          understand what Svelte Vietnam is and trying to be, read the blog post <a class="c-link"

            <strong>Maintain</strong> a stable and secure infrastructure (Cloudflare). Currently
            Svelte Vietnam is built and paid for by individual and voluntary effort. Having
            dedicated funding means these members will not have to paid for infrastructure cost out
            of their own pockets.
          two:
            <strong>Create</strong> high-quality content, events, and activities to promote
            community growth and open source initiatives.
