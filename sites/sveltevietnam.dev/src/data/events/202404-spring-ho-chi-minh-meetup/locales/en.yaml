      one:
        title: Svelte and Its Ecosystem
        desc: Svelte is still relatively new in Vietnam, not being as popular as other
          comparable technologies are; it is not uncommon that you have many unanswered
          questions and concerns. This Q&A session will hopefully help you gain a
          better insight. Ask away!
