    heading: Recap
    desc: This was the first event of the Svelte Vietnam community and the last of
      2023 as we came closer to the end of yet another year full of API changes and
      AI news. The event lasted for about two hours, with a combination of pre-record
      videos and live discussions. We took inspiration from past events of <a class="c-link"
      href="https://www.sveltesummit.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Svelte
      Summit</a>, <a class="c-link" href="https://viteconf.org/" rel="noreferrer"
      target="_blank">Vite Conf</a>, and other events in the web platform ecosystem,
      and hopefully would establish a precedent for many more events to come.
    shoutout: 'Shout out to community members who took time to join the meetup: Tymon,
      Bắc, Tuấn, and those in or outside the community who watched the livestream
      at Youtube.<br />A big thank to <a class="c-link" href="https://maiduchuy.com/" rel="noreferrer"
      target="_blank">Huy Mai</a> for giving us permission to use his music for the
      event.'
